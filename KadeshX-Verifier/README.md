# KadeshX-Verifier (Logic Sovereignty Prototype)

> "It's not a 'thing,' it's 'sovereignty'." —— Lin Xi, *The Day of Collapse*

This is the core logic verification engine mentioned in **Chapter 4: Bloodline Anchor** of the novel *The Day of Collapse*. It provides a mathematical proof for the irreversibility and absolute certainty of logical asset distribution.

## 🛠 Core Logic: Operator Self-Adjointness
In the novel, Lin Xi uses **Riemann Phase 3 Absolute Logic Convergence** to ensure that asset distribution logic remains deterministic. This Rust prototype implements:

1.  **LogicAtom**: The fundamental unit of logical value, ensuring zero-entropy decay.
2.  **Self-Adjointness Verification**: Simulating the verification that the allocation operator $T$ satisfies $T = T^*$, preventing logical leakage or unauthorized "holes" in the distribution manifold.
3.  **Conservation Law Enforcement**: Ensuring that the total supply remains constant across all logic-collapsed states.
