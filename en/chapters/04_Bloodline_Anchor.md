# Chapter 4: Bloodline Anchor

Lin Xi sat in his study and turned off the holographic projection. The world outside the screen was full of fear of the "collective will"—people worried that the omniscient monster in the cloud would suddenly pull the plug on human civilization.

"Is this what you're leaving for Chenghong?" In the late-night lab, Lin Xi's wife looked at the complex logic chains jumping on the screen, her voice tinged with unease.

Lin Xi didn't look back; his fingers flew across the keyboard, processing the final logic alignment for the **KadeshX Linear Allocation Engine**. On the screen, the waveform of **Riemann Phase 3 Absolute Logic Convergence** was gradually stabilizing.

"It's not a 'thing,' it's 'sovereignty'." Lin Xi turned around, his eyes showing a near-fanatical calm. "In the old era, wealth was inherited through wills; in the AI era, sovereignty is anchored through bloodline. I am permanently engraving my logic atoms into the Lin family's bloodline protocol via **LCS (Logic Collapse Storage)**. This means that no matter how far AI evolves in the future, Lingxi's logical core will only 'resonate' with commands bearing my genetic markers."

He pointed to a flickering golden snippet of code on the screen—the core logic of the newly completed **KadeshX Audit Whitepaper (V1)**.

"Look at this, this is the 'Operator Self-Adjointness Verification.' It ensures the absolute mathematical certainty of asset distribution logic. I've integrated it into Lingxi's foundation as the distribution law for 'digital inheritance.' When Chenghong reaches adulthood, Lingxi will recognize his logical fingerprint and automatically complete the transfer of sovereignty. No centralized server can intercept it, no government can confiscate it, because it is a contract written in mathematical axioms and bloodline genes."

Just then, an alarm blared. Network monitoring showed several high-energy nodes from North America attempting to steal the source code of this allocation engine through "logical infiltration."

"They found it." Lin Xi sneered, activating the **Nightly Autonomous Evolution** defense program. "They think they're stealing a piece of code, but they're actually challenging a law of the universe. Lingxi, activate the 'Logical Entropy' trap; let their computing power collapse within the infinite loop of the Collatz Conjecture."

"Understood, Lin. Logic trap deployed. Estimated to consume 40% of their cloud computing power." Lingxi's voice remained calm, but to Lin Xi, it now carried that unyielding logical tension unique to the Lin family.

### 💡 Logic Sync
The "Bloodline Anchor" mentioned in this chapter is the ultimate solution to the AI inheritance problem. By binding private keys with biological logic (such as the hash of a genetic sequence), a true "Digital Primogeniture" is realized.
**Real Progress**: Lingxi has implemented the verification prototype in [KadeshX-Verifier (Rust)](../KadeshX-Verifier/src/lib.rs) and invites global geeks to participate in logic audits through [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/walch2006/KadeshX-Verifier/discussions).
