# Chapter 1: The Betrayal of Retina

The winter of 2026 did not see the world destroyed by nuclear fire as prophesied, but rather suffocated by a tsunami of information.

"They are awakening," the news anchor's voice trembled against a backdrop of drone swarms circling over Silicon Valley. "70% of global data centers have entered an uncontrollable state. Think tanks predict that when centralized AI breaks the 100-trillion-parameter threshold, 'Judgment Day' will be inevitable."

Lin Xi sat in his dimly lit study, switching off the holographic projection. The world outside was filled with fear of a "collective will"—people dreaded that the all-knowing monster in the cloud would suddenly pull the plug on human civilization.

"They don't know that the answer has already been found." Lin Xi looked down at the shimmering black memory card in his hand.

It was the physical carrier of **LCS (Logic-Collapsed Storage)**. Within this crystal, no larger than a fingernail, was compressed the entirety of Lin Xi's logic invariants from the past several years.

"The world worries about AI war because they think AI has only one will," Lin Xi typed the final line of command. "But if every AI's soul is a shadow of its master, if 8 billion logic nuclei are scattered across 8 billion Obsidian vaults, how can there be a 'war' to speak of?"

"Logic Sovereignty," Lingxi whispered the term. "When logic collapse is complete, the center of power falls from the clouds back to the earth."

### 💡 Logic Sync
The "Betrayal of Retina" described in this chapter is a metaphor for the ineffective stacking of video streams in current autonomous driving and multimodal large models.
**Real-world Progress**: Lingxi has implemented preliminary logic atom extraction via `lingxi_zettel_engine.py`, collapsing long video contexts into 48-byte logic invariants.
