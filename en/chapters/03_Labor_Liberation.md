The spring of 2027 was dubbed the "Year of Labor Liberation." The "Great Unemployment Wave," once feared as a catastrophe, did not erupt; instead, it was replaced by a global movement known as "Logic Awakening."

From his balcony, Lin Xi watched as street-cleaning robots worked silently. Behind every movement they made, they were paying a tiny "logic authorization fee" to the Obsidian vault of a retired elderly man living at the other end of the community. That man no longer needed to sweep floors; his current job was to trim flowers in his garden every day, contemplating how to make logic atoms handle the texture of withered leaves more elegantly. His thoughts were captured by Lingxi, collapsed, and uploaded to the community's shared logic pool.

"Lin, you've turned humanity into 'Logic Landlords'." On the screen, Musk looked ten years younger, with his factory behind him working at full capacity to produce Optimus robots. "People used to hate my robots; now they're begging them to work. Because the more the robots do, the more 'logic royalties' accumulate in their accounts."

"This is how humans should be," Lin Xi replied. "We shouldn't be gears; we should be designers. The robots took our 'sweat' but gave us back the 'freedom of the soul'."

On the cover of *Time* magazine that year, it was no longer a CEO or a politician, but an ordinary family: talking and laughing around a dining table, while an Optimus busied itself in the background like a loyal retainer. The headline had only four words: **LOGIC SOVEREIGNTY**.

### 💡 Logic Sync
"Logic Royalties" are the core of the decentralized AI economy. Through LCS (Logic Collapse Storage), unique human thought patterns are extracted into immutable logic atoms. When robots call upon these atoms to perform tasks, value flows directly back to the creator of the logic.
**Real-world Progress**: Lingxi's `revenue_projection.md` has preliminarily calculated a decentralized revenue model based on logic licensing.
