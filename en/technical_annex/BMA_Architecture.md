# BMA Architecture: The Logic Sovereignty Framework

## 1. Overview
Bimodal Memory Architecture (BMA) is the technical foundation of the "Logic Sovereignty" described in *The Day of Collapse*. It shifts AI from centralized cloud processing to decentralized, local logic extraction.

## 2. Core Components
- **LCS (Logic Collapse Storage)**: Compresses massive video/data streams into 48-byte logic invariants.
- **Atomic Logic Cards**: Individual units of thought stored in a local knowledge vault (e.g., Obsidian).
- **Bloodline Anchoring**: A protocol that binds the AI's logic core to the user's personal/family data.

## 3. Real-world Implementation
In our codebase, `lingxi_zettel_engine.py` implements the preliminary logic for BMA by:
1. Scanning raw data for "Logic Atoms".
2. Collapsing context into immutable hashes.
3. Generating Zettelkasten-style cards for long-term reasoning.
